As part of my Spring2025 Mentorship with Out in Tech, I created a Family Tree program in C++.
This program goes beyond what other programs allow you to do in terms of depicting a diverse range of relationships such as children of divorce, children of different parents, and polyamory.

The tree is visualized using the GraphViz library. 

Below is an example of a family tree created using this program, which depicts some familiar characters and some made up ones.

As you can see, Peter, Wade and Mary Jane are all in a polyamorous relationship. This is depicted by them being grouped together in a light pink box. They don't all share the same children, however. Peter's children consist of Anne Parker and Rose Vera Garcia. Mary Jane does not have any children. Wade's children are Eliana P. Garcia and Rose Vera Garcia. Peter and Wade are both parents to Rose Vera Garcia, so they both get an arrow pointing to Rose.
